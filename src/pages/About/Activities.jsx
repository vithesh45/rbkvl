          <p>
            It is one of the fundamental objectives of the Union to carry out
            activities for enhancing milk production in its milk shed area. To
            achieve this, various technical input services like veterinary
            health care, artificial insemination services, vaccination, supply
            of balanced cattle feed, and quality fodder seeds are provided to
            boost milk production and the economic development of the farming
            community.

          <h2>Animal Health and Emergency Services</h2>
          <p>
            The Union is dedicated to promoting the health of cattle belonging
            to member milk producers. Veterinary health care facilities have
            been extended to all DCS. Emergency veterinary routes, health
            camps, and vaccinations against foot and mouth disease are
            provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mass deworming programs are conducted twice a year at all DCS.
            Backup veterinary first aid services are provided through trained
            DCS staff. Introduction of Trio-NB-Sac and &apos;Godhara
            Shakthi&apos; has further improved milk quality.

        <div className="about-block">
          <h2>Artificial Insemination Activities</h2>
          <p>
            Artificial insemination has been a key functional tool in driving
            the development of dairying. To improve the genetic potential and
            milk production of cattle, the cluster AI concept was adopted in
            1994, successfully reaching the majority of producers at their
            doorsteps.

        <div className="about-block">
          <h2>Fodder Activity</h2>
          <p>
            The Union has developed farms for production of fodder seeds and
            root slips, which are distributed to producers at subsidized
            rates. Balanced cattle feed and mineral mixtures are supplied
            through DCS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Farmers are educated on enriching dry fodder with urea and trained
            to establish silage demonstrations to reduce milk production
            costs. Cultivation of azolla is promoted due to its high protein
            content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chaff cutters are provided at subsidized rates to prevent fodder
            wastage, and training programs are conducted for elite producers
            to enhance fodder development.

          <p>
            To improve raw milk quality, the Clean Milk Production (CMP)
            program has been launched. Bulk Milk Coolers have been installed
            in several DCS, with more in the pipeline.
          </p>
          <p>
            Automatic Milk Collection Units and Electronic Milk Testers have
            been introduced to replace traditional manual testing methods,

            Government schemes like Yashaswini Health Insurance Scheme and
