        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>
          Under the World Bank aided Karnataka Dairy Development Projects, the
          activities on Dairy Development were taken up in the year 1975. The
          Mysore Coop Milk Producers Societies Union Ltd was established on
          23.11.1976, having the jurisdiction extended to the entire Mysore
          District and Five Taluks of Mandya District. The Union undertook the
          work of organization of Milk Co-operatives in ‘AMUL Pattern’ with the
          main objective of socio-economic reformation of the farmers in the
          rural areas through Dairying as main subsidiary occupation.
