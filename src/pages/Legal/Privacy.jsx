          <h2>Location</h2>
          <p>
            This app collects location data to enable Check-in/Check-out
            functionality even when the app is closed or not in use. A
            notification is displayed to the user when location is being
            captured. Users are prompted before location capture starts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the user enables check-out, the location capture is stopped.
            We do not share the captured location with external sources.
